__**Latest Changes**__

Playlist are now protected by ownership!
No more pranks from you your funny friends. Lets just hope you don't get pranked by an admin.
Now this doesn't mean that no one but you can play the playlist, or see the songs in it. It just means that you are the only one that can edit it.
Though if you feel like sharing, you can do so as well. Just remember that only you as the creator can share your playlists.

Also you can now delete you playlist if you really want. Just make sure you actually want to do so. It cannot be undone.
Also make sure not to add something that you shouldn't, any admin can delete you playlist.

**Specifics**
If you still don't understand the ownership of the playlists this is the detailed explanation.
When you create a new playlist, you will be the 'original owner' this gives you complete control over the playlist. You can choose to share you playlist though. When you do that user is considered an 'owner', no to be confused with you as the 'original owner'. A owner can do everything you can except: share, delete and make the playlist public; these are still for you only.
There is however an exception to this as well. Admins can, regardless of ownership 'original' or otherwise, add and remove songs to the playlist, and delete it all together.
